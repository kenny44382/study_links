        "  - slicing functions (SFs), handles the reality that many datasets have certain subsets or slices that are more important than others. In Snorkel, we can write SFs to (a) monitor specific slices and (b) improve model performance over them by adding representational capacity targeted on a per-slice basis.\n",
